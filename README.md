Your task is as follows - 

Project "Tuesday - not monday": Recreate the following interface as shown in the attached GIF.

Important - Focus only on the layout implementation, the content of each window (or widget) should be kept empty!
1. Project Setup:
Create a new React project using Create React App or Vite.
Install and configure Tailwind CSS.
2. Component Structure:
Develop a main Dashboard component.
Create subcomponents for:
Header
Widget
Any additional components you may find useful
3. Header Component:
Implement the top bar with a custom title.
Add functional "View" and "Edit" buttons.
Don't Include icons for notifications, messages, profile, etc, but do maintain the same structure.
4. Widget Component:
The Widgets need to be resizable and draggable.
You may use a third-party library, or implement your own solution.
5. Responsive Design:
Ensure the layout is responsive using Tailwind's utility classes.
Don't implement a separate mobile view or worry about mobile appearance.
6. State Management:
Use React hooks (useState, useContext) for local and global state management.
Bonus: Save and reload the current layout state to LocalStorage
7. Interactivity:
Add click handler only for the View/Edit toggle.
8. Deliverables:
GitHub repository with the complete source code.
Instructions for running the project locally.
A brief explanation of design decisions and any third-party libraries used.
